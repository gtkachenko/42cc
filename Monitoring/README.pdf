# Monitoring and Logging Strategy

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Prometheus/Grafana

1. **Response Time:**
   - Metric: `http_request_duration_seconds`
   - Monitoring the time it takes for HTTP requests to complete.

2. **Error Rate:**
   - Metric: `http_request_errors`
   - Monitoring the rate of errors in HTTP requests.

3. **Resource Utilization:**
   - Metrics: `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`
   - Monitoring CPU and memory utilization to ensure efficient resource allocation.

4. **Throughput:**
   - Metric: `http_requests_total`
   - Monitoring the total number of HTTP requests handled.

5. **Database Performance:**
   - Metrics: `database_query_duration_seconds`, `database_errors`
   - Monitoring the duration and error rate of database queries.

6. **Network Latency:**
   - Metric: `network_latency_seconds`
   - Monitoring the latency in network communication.

7. **Custom Business Metrics:**
   - Metrics specific to your application's business logic and performance.

### ELK Stack

1. **Application Logs:**
   - Aggregating logs from various application components.

2. **Error Logs:**
   - Aggregating logs with error messages or exceptions.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Aggregating logs related to security events.

4. **Audit Logs:**
   - Aggregating logs for auditing purposes.

5. **Performance Logs:**
   - Aggregating logs for performance-related information.

## Aggregation and Analysis of Logs

### Logstash

- **Input:**
  - Receive logs from various sources using input plugins (e.g., Filebeat, syslog).

- **Filter:**
  - Apply filters to parse, enrich, and structure logs (e.g., grok patterns).

- **Output:**
  - Send processed logs to Elasticsearch for storage.

### Elasticsearch

- **Indexing:**
  - Index logs based on time, source, and other relevant metadata.

- **Search and Query:**
  - Use Elasticsearch Query DSL to search and filter logs based on different criteria.

- **Rotate Indexes:**
  - Use ILM to rotate index lifecycle based on the time or index size.

### Kibana

- **Visualization:**
  - Create visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and tables to represent log data.

- **Dashboard:**
  - Build custom dashboards in Kibana to aggregate and visualize logs from different sources.

- **Discover:**
  - Use the Discover tab in Kibana to interactively explore and search logs.

## Alerts

- **Prometheus Alerts:**
  - Configure alerts based on thresholds for key metrics (e.g., response time, error rate).

- **Grafana Alerts:**
  - Create alerts within Grafana based on metric thresholds.

- **ELK Stack Alerts:**
  - Set up Watcher alerts in Elasticsearch for log-based anomalies or patterns.

## Integration of Metrics and Logs

- **Correlation:**
  - Utilize trace IDs or unique identifiers in logs to correlate logs with metrics.

- **Grafana and Kibana Integration:**
  - Use Grafana and Kibana together to visualize metrics and logs in a unified manner.

## Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Establish a feedback loop for continuously improving monitoring and logging based on incident analysis.

- **Automated Remediation:**
  - Explore possibilities for automated remediation based on detected issues.

By combining the monitoring of key metrics with effective log aggregation and analysis, you create a comprehensive strategy to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your application's performance and reliability. Regularly review and update configurations to adapt to evolving application needs and industry best practices.
